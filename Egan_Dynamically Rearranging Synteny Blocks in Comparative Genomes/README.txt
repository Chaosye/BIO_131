SUMMARY
--------------------------------
Program that takes in two strings, and gets the first string as close as 
possible to the second string by flipping around sections of that first 
string.  Inspired by synteny blocks and DNA rearrangements of common genes 
between animals with common ancestors.  Keeps track of the flipping as well,
and then uploads a graphical depiction of the sequence to Reed's edition of 
GraphSpace.
