def main():
	## 1. Consider the following DNA sequence.  Create two variables that contain 
    ## the complement of the DNA sequence and the reverse complement of the DNA
	## sequence.  Do this by hand.
	dna = 'ATAGCATTGC'
	print('DNA:',dna)

	## 2. Write a function to return the complement of a string.

	## 3. Write a function to return the reverse of a string.

	## 4. Write a function to compute the reverse complement
	## of a string.  Return this string.

	## 5. Use an IF statement to print 'Correct Answer!' if the computed
	## sequence and the hand-written sequences match and 'Incorrect Answer'
	## otherwise.
	return 

## Start writing functions here.
